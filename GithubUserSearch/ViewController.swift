         * 3. set distribution property to fillEqually so its clear how much space each view should take
         * 4. add as many views as you'd like to it
         * 5. the more views you add the less height they're going to have since they take equal space in the stack view
         * 6. place it on the entire screen with constraints following how we did it last lesson
         * 6b. Refresher: set translates... to false, add to subview, activate constraints
